# Predictive Modeling for Material Fatigue

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using predictive modeling techniques to estimate the fatigue life of materials based on various factors. We implemented and validated multiple regression models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and neural networks. The goal was to identify the best model for predicting material fatigue life and understand the impact of factors like laser energy density and build orientation on the material's performance.

## Key Features
- Implemented multiple regression models (KNN, SVR, Random Forest, and Neural Network).
- Identified Random Forest as the most accurate model with an 89% accuracy for predicting material fatigue life.
- Used Polynomial Fitting to analyze the effects of laser energy density and build orientation on material fatigue.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow` (for neural network implementation)
  - `scipy`
